# Binary Search Tree in Java

This project implements a basic **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java, supporting common operations such as:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search (Find)
- Inorder Traversal

The code is written in a clean, object-oriented style, with recursive methods for clarity and simplicity.

## Features

- **Insert**: Add a new node to the tree.
- **Delete**: Remove a node by key, handling all three deletion cases (no child, one child, two children).
- **Find**: Search for a node by key.
- **Traverse**: Print the tree using inorder traversal.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/abdulalisadaqat/binary-search-tree-in-java.git`  
   cd `binary-search-tree-in-java`  
   compile the codes and run the `Demo.java` file
